Thank you for downloading this asset! :)
I hope that you're able to use it to its
fullest extent. If you do, send me a message or post
a comment on OpenGameArt so I can see what people
are doing with it! 

To open the .sbs file, you will need access to Substance Designer.
This was created in 2019.1.2 and should work with older version, but
I haven't tested it so I don't know for sure. Open with older versions
at your own risk.
